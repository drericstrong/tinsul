TInsul
==================================
TInsul (Transformer INSULation simulator) is a Python module to simulate condition-monitoring data for the paper insulation of large-scale transformers. It might be used to test new prognostics algorithms, as a teaching aid for those new to the field of condition-monitoring, or to compare the results from simulated data to real-world applications.
